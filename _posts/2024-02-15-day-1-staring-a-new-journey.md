Thought of writing my daily happenings online, I don't know why. Just felt like it.<br>

Maybe in future if I become successful or fail miserably, I will be able to look back at what steps led me to that future.<br>

Think of this like a pet project of mine, an **Time Machine**.<br>

## Today is Day 1

What happened in my life today?, today I invested some of my hard earned money, created this beautiful looking personal blog, worked on web development project a little that I have been working on for the past few months.<br>

Wasn't able to play "last day on earth" game during day because was too busy, maybe later.<br>

Also thinking of getting back to my personal projects that I have been procrastinating for a while.<br>

Other than that went for a birthday party and spent first half of the day doing nothing.<br>

That's all for today.
