Accidentally closed the browser tab and got logged out of accounts used for a project.<br>

Now have to contact client again asking for login authentication codes, and he's been offline for 2 days already. This sucks, like a lot. <br>

Thus spent the rest of the day with a little bit of work on my motorcycle blog [Offroadpioneers.com](https://offroadpioneers.com/)<br>

Played some ldoe and now at night will go for a birthday party, then will watch a thriller movie and end the day.<br>

Cya.
